> Pa11y runner for HTML validation with the [Nu Html Checker (v.Nu)](https://validator.github.io/validator/).

## Usage

> üöß Currently the runner is only compatible with PR [#524 ‚Äì¬†Add lower-level runner API to support non-browser runners](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y/pull/524), and on my fork [thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners).

**V.Nu first needs to be installed separately, with a standalone [`vnu` binary](https://validator.github.io/validator/).**

```sh
# On macOS,
brew install vnu
# Elsewhere, grab the latest release from
# https://github.com/validator/validator/releases/latest.
# Make sure the `vnu` executable is in your PATH.
# Then,
npm install -g https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners pa11y-runner-vnu
```

With `vnu`, Pa11y, and the runner installed,

```sh
pa11y --runner vnu https://www.example.com/
```

## Why

When it comes to finding accessibility issues, HTML validation ranks [poorly](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/) compared to dedicated tools. Nonetheless, I find it valuable for a few reasons:

- Developers understand it well. Accessibility guidelines can be hard to grasp for newcomers, while ‚Äúvalid HTML‚Äù is a well understood concept.
- It‚Äôs ubiquitous. There are well established tools for HTML validation, they‚Äôve been there forever. A lot of web developers have already used them.
- It finds issues much closer to the code than other methods. If the HTML is malformed, a validator picks this up right away, in very clear terms.

Here are examples of issues I wouldn‚Äôt have found if it wasn‚Äôt for HTML validation:

- [Forcing `row="table"` on all tables](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/5977)
